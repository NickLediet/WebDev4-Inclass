# PHP Movie Site

An on going inclass example of a CRUD site built in PHP and MySQL.

## Setup

Rename ```admin/phpscripts/connectExample.php``` to ```connect.php``` and change the Database credentials where needed.  

Then either place the folder in your ```htdocs``` or ```www``` directory on your webserver. Or you can simply run ```php -S localhost:8080``` in your command line to run it from anywhere.
